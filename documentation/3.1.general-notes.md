# IDS Notes

## IDS Authorization Code Protocol

ids will set a session cookie for each user authenticate with it.

## SAMl VS Oauth2.0

saml is old
it use http/https same like authorization code flow but with xml saml token and it has big disadvantage by it is has no refresh token so it can't be use for offline access specially for mobile apps

## OAuth2. vs OpenID Connect

OAuth is for authorization
OpenID is for authentication

## Public Clients vs Private Clients

public client = SPA
Private client = mvc

# 🚀 What’s New in OAuth 2.1?

OAuth 2.1 is an **evolution** of OAuth 2.0, designed to simplify security best practices and remove outdated or insecure features. Instead of introducing entirely new concepts, **OAuth 2.1 consolidates best practices** from OAuth 2.0 and related security recommendations.

## 🔑 Key Changes in OAuth 2.1

### 1️⃣ **📛 Implicit Flow is Removed**

❌ **Implicit Grant (`response_type=token`) is no longer allowed.**  
🔒 **Why?**

- Tokens were exposed in URLs, making them vulnerable to **leakage** and **man-in-the-middle attacks**.
- **Better alternative**: Use **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**, even for SPAs (Single Page Applications).

---

### 2️⃣ **🔐 PKCE is Mandatory for All Clients**

✅ **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is now required for all Authorization Code flows** (not just public clients like mobile apps).  
🔒 **Why?**

- Protects against **authorization code interception attacks**.
- Eliminates the need for **client secrets** in public clients.

✅ **PKCE Flow Example:**

```http
GET /authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&
response_type=code&
code_challenge=CODE_CHALLENGE&
code_challenge_method=S256
```

---

### 3️⃣ **🔄 Password Grant is Removed**

❌ **Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) Grant is no longer supported.**  
🔒 **Why?**

- Encouraged **bad security practices** (apps storing plaintext passwords).
- **Better alternative**: Use **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** or **Device Authorization Flow**.

---

### 4️⃣ **🛡️ Refresh Tokens Must Be Used Securely**

✅ **Refresh Tokens now require sender-constrained mechanisms or must be rotated.**  
🔒 **Why?**

- Prevents **reuse attacks** if refresh tokens are stolen.

✅ **Best Practices:**

- **Automatic Rotation**: A new refresh token is issued each time the old one is used.
- **Bound to Client**: Tokens should be bound to the client using **MTLS (Mutual TLS)** or **DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession)**.

---

### 5️⃣ **🎯 Access Token Usage is Clarified**

✅ **OAuth 2.1 makes it clear that Access Tokens should not be used for authentication.**  
🔒 **Why?**

- Access tokens **only authorize API access**.
- For authentication, **use OpenID Connect (OIDC) and ID Tokens** instead.

✅ **Better alternative:**

- If you need **user authentication**, use **OIDC** and request an **ID Token**.
